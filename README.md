## git-label-faces
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Label your issues with face labels like a boss.

![](http://i.imgur.com/fOGX3oQ.png)

This is a package that can be used with [`git-label`](https://github.com/jasonbellamy/git-label) and/or [`git-label-cli`](https://github.com/jasonbellamy/git-label-cli) to produce some fun (and fairly non-descript) git labels.

#### How-to

The labels are [just a simple JSON file](https://github.com/himynameisdave/git-label-faces/blob/master/git-label-faces.json), so you can copy/paste them directly if you really want.

Otherwise you can clone the repo...

```
git clone git@github.com:himynameisdave/git-label-faces.git
```

...or just install it via NPM like most people will:

```
npm i git-label-faces
```

After you have the `git-label-faces.json` file locally, you can follow the instructions to use with `git-label-cli`, or via `git-label`'s [find method](https://github.com/jasonbellamy/git-label#find-pattern-).

#### Contributing/Add A Face

Got a cool face? Slap a neat color on it (one that hasn't been used plz) and submit your pull request!
